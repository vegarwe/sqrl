Discussion points:

Transaction #1
Server is not key/value pair

To check a signature of client=123&server=567
- Split and join into 1234567.... Bad business

This localhost:9999
- Seems like such a kludge

What about pids2, pids3, pids4 (I loose my identity a lot)

0x100: Bad ID Association:
- Information leakage?
