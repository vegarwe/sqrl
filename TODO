Client
======

Discussion points:
=================

Transaction #1
- Server is not key/value pair

To check a signature of client=123&server=567
- Split and join into 1234567.... Bad business

This localhost:25519
- Seems like such a kludge

0x100: Bad ID Association:
- Information leakage?

(solved) What about pids2, pids3, pids4 (I loose my identity a lot)
